# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-ML
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation. Dimensions are nothing but features that represent the data.One important thing to note about PCA is that it is an Unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, you can cluster the similar data points based on the feature correlation between them without any supervision (or labels)  Here in this Project we are using Dermotology Data Set
